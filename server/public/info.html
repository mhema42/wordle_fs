          In the navigation bar, you can choose WORDLE to play the game, go to
          this INFORMATION page, or list the HIGHSCORE of players who has
          entered their name.
        </p>
        <p>
          To play the game, you have the option to select if you want only
          unique letters or if there can be two or more of the same letter in
          the word to guess for. Then you choose length on word to guess for (4,
          5 or 6 letters).
        </p>
        <p>
          After you made your choise, you enter a word you guess is correct and
          the game shows if a letter in the guessed word is correct (green
          color), correct but missplaced (yellow color) and incorrect (red
          color), you keep on guessing until you guessed the correct word.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you guessed the correct word, the game will display how many
          guesses you made and your time. And you have the option to enter your
          name to send result to highscore-list.
